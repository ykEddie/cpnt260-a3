### Reflection

I actually struggled with this assignment quite a bit. I was unable to make the page responsive without using a media query and a lot of things didn't work the way I hoped they would (footer for example I'm sure there's a problem somewhere but I can't seem to find it). Other than the few problems I faced I think I understand how I can use this type of thing for other projects/assignments. Getting all the images to show up when I ran the live server was also a problem because I didn't enter the full path for each image at first so it wasn't responding/finding anything it needed.
